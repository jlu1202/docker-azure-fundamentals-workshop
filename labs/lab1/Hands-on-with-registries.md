# Working containers with Registries

In this lab you will be introduced Docker Repositories.  In the previous lab we created a custom image using Asp.Net Core and a Dockerfile.  This is great for development but it's not useful if we can share that image with the rest of the team or our other environments.  In this lab we will create Container Registry in Azure and push our images to it.

## Let's get started

1. Login into Azure and create [Azure Container Registry](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry):

8. sign in

10. pull.
